# Code for papers:
- Chen, Guozhang, Franz Scherr, and Wolfgang Maass. “[A data-based large-scale model for primary visual cortex enables brain-like robust and versatile visual processing.](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abq7592)” Science Advances 8.44 (2022): eabq7592.
- Chen, Guozhang, Franz Scherr, and Wolfgang Maass. “[Data-based large-scale models provide a window into the organization of cortical computations.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.28.538662v3.abstract)” bioRxiv (2023): 2023-04.

# To run the code
- Please follow the instruction in "install_a_conda_enviroment" first.
- Download supporting files from [here](https://cloud.tugraz.at/index.php/s/JmDakasAHEqsA9J)
- Make sure the file structure is like:
  dir/parent_folder/GLIF_network/network
  
  parent_folder should contain alternate_small_stimuli.pkl, many_small_stimuli.pkl, EA_LGN.h5 (these three are for dataset)
  
  GLIF_network should contain input_dat.pkl, network_dat.pkl,
  
  network contains ‘v1_node_types.csv’ and ‘v1_nodes.h5’
  
  When you run the code, you should give dir/parent_folder/GLIF_network to flag "data_dir".
  
  For LGN supporting file, you have to give it in /lgn_model/lgn.py line 88-99 where I hard coded there. Or, you can specify the path to lgn_full_col_cells_3.csv as an argument when you call LGN in stim_dataset.py.
- do ```python multi_training.py``` to train the V1 model for 5 tasks together.
